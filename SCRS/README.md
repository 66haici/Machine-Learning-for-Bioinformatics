
#### Clustering and Analyzing Single Cell RNA sequencing.

Single-cell RNA sequencing examines the gene expression level of individual cells in a given population by simultaneously measuring the mRNA concentration of hundreds to thousands of genes. Heterogenous cell populations, coming from different tissues that are sequenced and quantified together, makes reconstruction of cellular developmental trajectories and modelling of transcriptional dynamicsd difficult and impossoble, however they are made possible through analysis of single cell transcriptomic data.

Traditional and previous genomic studies are limited as they provide measurements for whole tissues and as a result show an average expression profile for all the constituent cells. In multicellular organisms different cell types within the same population can have distinct roles and form subpopulations with different transcriptional profiles. Correlations in the gene expression of the subpopulations can often be missed due to the lack of subpopulation identification. Such technique fail to identify if a change in the expression profile is due to a change in regulation or composition, in which one cell type arises to dominate the population. 

The general experimental steps for Single Cell RNA sequencing would be:
* solating single cells
  * isolate and amplify cells for single-cell analysis. Low throughput techniques and High throughput techniques available
* Quantitative PCR
  * To measure the level of expression of each transcript qPCR can be applied
* Single-cell RNA-seq:
  * The RNA-seq approach is generally regarded as the most precise method to measure the levels of transcripts and is able to generate data for tens of thousands of genes i.e the whole transcriptome
